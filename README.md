# SparQ
Simple command line text editor. Keeps text in a custom linked list, one line in a separate node. Can be called from the command line using command line arguments to edit a file. (Not just .txt files!) This project takes a back to basics approach and avoids using any newer C++ vector libraries and relies solely on a C++ custom Linked List object using pointers.
